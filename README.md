# Cloudflare Bypass Script

  



![](https://github.com/sarperavci/CloudflareBypassForScraping/blob/main/example.gif)


This Python script is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates a basic method for interacting with websites protected by Cloudflare. Please use this script responsibly and only on websites for which you have proper authorization.

  

## Prerequisites

  

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

  

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 

- [Chromium Browser](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium) (or Chrome)

  

## Installation

  

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

  

```bash

git clone https://github.com/sarperavci/CloudflareBypassForScraping.git

```

  

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  

```bash

cd CloudflareBypassForScraping

```

  

3. Install the required Python packages:

  

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

  

## Usage

  

1. Edit the script to specify the URL of the website you want to interact with and don't forget to change browser_path from the file (line:17). It both works in Windows and Linux, without requiring webdriver. It directly works with the browser:

  

```python

# Change this line to your desired website URL

driver.get('https://example.com')

```

  

2. Run the script:

  

```bash

python cloudflare_bypass.py

```

  

3. The script will attempt to bypass the Cloudflare protection and interact with the specified website. Please be patient as it may take some time to complete. Ensure that you only use this script on websites where you have explicit authorization.

## Drissionpage
To find out how to use DrissionPage, which I used in this script as a controller, check out the documentation of it. Be sure while reading you use an English translater, otherwise it'll be a lot harder :D
